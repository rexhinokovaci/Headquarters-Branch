"  You have just been employed by an international company as an IT security engineer. They have just built another remote site in another city and want to integrate their new network in the system. It means that you have to design and implement their new network and try to redesign the old one. In the design phase you have to take into consideration the security procedures that you have learnt. You have to make a secure and logical partition for the existing and new departments.  "
